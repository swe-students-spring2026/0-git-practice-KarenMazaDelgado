Its interesting how at some universities, computer science higher education cirricula is developing to be AI-centric. Often when people graduate with CS degrees, they become software devlopers/engineers and many feel that their education did not actually prepare them for the work they do on a daily basis. The article detials the specific changes a university (UW-Madison) has undergone to adapt to the current state of technology. A new college was developed combining Computer Science, Data Science, Information Technology, and Statistics. The combination of these is meant to aid aspiring software developers integrate AI. I think it's interesting how AI has changed the field of software enginnering itsled. It mirrors the imapct of the World Wide Web decades ago. Its also interesting to see universities approaches and changes regarding AI and how to incorporate it, especially for future sfotware enginners. Though is it useful to learn about AI itself and how it works? Its difficult to determine if changes like these, additions of colleges, change in ciricula etc will prepare students for the workforce. 
Though sometimes traditional classes can have a usecase. Often software engieners have to deal with keeping things running. Ciurses like operating sysems prepare students for software engineering by helping them understand fundamentals when curating systems.  LLMs may have trouble with things like memory leaks and ressource constraints. I imagine the addition of this college has some of the fundamental courses that may be useful for sofetware egnieering since its gearing toward managing systems and designig for reliability and sacling.
